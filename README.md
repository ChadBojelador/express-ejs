# ExpressJS with EJS and Firebase
Learn how to build a basic web application before jumping into ReactJS or NextJS.

Before you start reading this, I hope you already have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You don’t need to know everything, but you should understand the major concepts of these basic frontend tech stack.

**Why should I learn this?**<br>
Understanding the concepts of both backend and frontend development is essential. Learning ExpressJS and EJS can help you grasp these concepts effectively.

Additionally, if you're participating in a hackathon where you need to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), this knowledge will help you create one quickly and efficiently.

**What can we learn from this?**<br>
You’ll learn how to work with a database, including fetching and posting data. You'll also learn how to connect the backend to the frontend.

**After building your first application, not just a todo app, consider working on a more advanced project like an e-commerce or social media application. I guarantee that transitioning to ReactJS or NextJS will feel natural and won’t overwhelm you.**
